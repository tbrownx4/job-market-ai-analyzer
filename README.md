# AI-Powered Job Market & Skill Insight Analyzer

This project analyzes real job postings using Python and basic machine learning to uncover in-demand skills and predict job categories from job descriptions.


## Motivation

As a computer science student learning Python and machine learning,
I wanted to better understand how the descriptions translate into real skill requirements.
Many students struggle to know which skills to focus on,
so this project explores how data and AI can help turn job postings into clear career insights.


## Dataset

The dataset consists of real U.S. job postings related to data and technology roles.
It includes job titles, companies, and full job descriptions. 
While the dataset is not real-time, it is well-suited for learning natural language processing and identifying common patterns in skill demand.


## Tools & Technologies

- Python
- Pandas (data analysis)
- Scikit-learn (machine learning)
- TF-IDF (text vectorization)
- Logistic Regression (classification)
- Google Colab
- GitHub


## Project Workflow

1. Loaded and explored job posting data
2. Cleaned and analyzed job descriptions
3. Identified common job titles and skill related terms
4. Converted text data into numerical features using TF-IDF
5. Trained a machine learning model to predict job categories
6. Interpreted results to extract meaningful career insights


## Key Insights

- Certain skills consistently appear across many roles, highlighting their importance for entry-level candidates
- Job descriptions for similar roles often use overlapping language
- Even simple machine learning models can uncover useful patterns in career-related data


## What I Learned

- How to work real world, messy data
- The importance of data cleaning before modeling
- How natural language processing turns text into usable features
- How to explain machine learning concepts in simple terms


## Future Improvements

- Add a resume-to-job matching feature
- Use newer or larger datasets
- Deploy the project as a simple web application for user interaction
